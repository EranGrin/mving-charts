# mving-charts
A new way to visualise data 

## Based on 
- plotly js

## Project intentions
- To create multidimensional animated charts/graphs 
- To call data from external source (csv file) 

## Problem 
- In the business world, one often wants to check the products sells/costs/margins over a given period of time 
- Unfortunately, there are not many tools that offer a way to present the data animation of the charts

## Solution
- With the help of plotly it might be possible to present animated complex data visualisationÂ 

## Present achievement
- Static data bar graph with an animation slide bar (single product)
- Static data group bar graph with an animation slide bar (multi measurements)
- Dynamically call data from CSV file to create a data bar graph with an animation slide bar (single product)

## Goals
- Dynamically call data from CSV file to create a data bar graph with an animation slide bar with multi-products
- Connect to Google sheets source
